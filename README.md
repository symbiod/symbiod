We want to build a place, where anyone can take part in development of opensource projects, that will help non-profits to bring value to the people.

The approach is that we connect individuals, that have an idea of some useful non-profit project(or event profitable, but tolerant to having the code open to everyone) and developers who wants to participate in those projects.

As a result the author gets the MVP of his project, and developers get experience in real projects(which is very important for beginners).
Experienced developers will be able to practice in leading teams, managing the project or event hiring our members for their companies.
